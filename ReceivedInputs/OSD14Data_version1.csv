The ocean sampling day samples were obtained as a collaboration of SIO, NOAA, and JCVI, and with accompanying metadata will help further our understanding of ecosystem dynamics at this site by providing a snap shot of diversity at the molecular level.The Scripps pier site has been a major long term coastal sampling site on the west coast of the USA since the 1920s.",2014-06-21T18:49,32.86698,-117.25725,0,USA,402,California Current,0,North Pacific Ocean,1908,marine biome ENVO:00000447,surface water ENVO:00002042,sea water ENVO:00002149,"Bucket, YSI",Below is sterivex filters.
